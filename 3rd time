#3rd time founders focus on strategy

1st time founders focus on product. 2nd time founders focus on distribution

But what do 3rd time founders focus on?

The thing which I learned from my second startup can be best summarized by Peter Thiel's line "you are not a lottery ticket"

AKA strategy matters

VCs can afford to be flippant about what businesses they invest in because they have a portfolio. But founders can't

There's this idea out there that you can "pivot" your way to a good idea. But it's just not the case. The more progress you make. The harder it is to change anything

All the pivoting needs to happen before you start. Before you have a team

Which is just a way of saying that you need to be thoughtful about strategy
