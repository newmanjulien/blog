I'm a little curious about people who want to "give a better life" to their children

The underlying belief seems to be that there are external factors which made their life worse than other people's lives. For example, they might be a single mom who is stuck working in a low level job as a waitress which somehow makes their life more hard than other people

Presumably, the people who have better lives are more integrated into various institutions and have more financial ressources

I question whether there's anything to this

It doesn't seem to me that these mythical people with better lives actually exist

At least, not based on external factors

I'm sure there are people who have better lives. Due to better and more moral decisions. But I haven't personally come across people who actually have a leg up on anything that matters based on the factors these people seem to feel are important

I have noticed that the country or city you live in matters a lot. For example, a person in Venezuela or Ghana doesn't have access to useful frameworks for having good life outcomes

But I don't feel this truly correlates with wealth or prestige of the country. For example, I'd wager you're better off being from North Korea than from France
