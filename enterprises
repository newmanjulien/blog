#Enterprise AI is a waste of time

Incumbent businesses failed to transition to the internet

And there's no reason to believe they'll be better at transitioning to AI

In fact, you'd need to see strong data to suggest that they'll succeed before even considering that they might

The story people tell is that incumbents didn't take the internet seriously. And they'll succeed with AI because they're taking it seriously

But are they taking AI seriously?

They spent money on pilots. But how have they changed what they're doing? Probably not at all

A downstream effect if this is true. Would be that startups shouldn't be selling to enterprises

If enterprises aren't actually using AI. And most of them are not going to survive the transition to AI. Startups should be selling to customers who will actually use their tech
