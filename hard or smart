#Work hard or work smart?

The problem with the hard vs smart dichotomy lies in how "work" is defined

And properly defining work exposes that hard and smart work are both the same thing

Work SHOULD be defined as
-> actively getting things done

Work should NOT be defined as
-> activities that feel unpleasant

Maximally hard work means investing as many hours as possible into actively getting things done. This doesn't doing a bunch of activities which feel unpleasant. Rather, it means being completely focused on getting things done and doing whatever is most likely to get the right things done as fast as possible without making mistakes which might set you back

Maximally smart work means getting as much done as possible by doing whatever is most likely to get the right things done as fast as possible without making mistakes which might set you back. And doing that involves being completely focused on getting things done and investing as many hours as possible into getting things done

...in other words, they're both the same

Example

- You might want to sell to lots of customers
- To accomplish this, you wouldn't just cold call a bunch of people
- You would first invest lots of time into learning what to do
- You would think through what to do
- You would actively test out ideas
- Then you'd scale the ideas which work as aggressively as possible

Sometimes the work might involve just taking a walk and letting ideas mature. Sometimes the work might involve doing repetitive tasks you dislike. But they're both work

But wait...

If "actively getting things done" can mean taking a walk and not really be thinking about work. Then wouldn't be included in that definition?

Distractions

Fighting with your girlfriend. Dealing with your aging parents. Picking up your kids from school

Anything that matters and which isn't work

The real thing is that's hard about work is that you need to do activities which feel unpleasant. But rather that you need to remove important things that actually matter from you life so you can remain completely fixated on getting things done
