#10/2 is the new 80/20

The insight I had missed about the 80/20 rule is that the 20% of nodes which create/capture 80% of the value are also paretto distributed

AKA 20% of the 20% capture 80% of the 80%

Which means that it's just a small number of nodes which capture an overwhelming amount of value in a large scale paretto distributed system

There actually aren't that many systems which are sufficiently large and paretto distributed

But one such system is wealth in India

In India, 10 individuals have +2% of the wealth

Hence the 10/20 rule

This matters mostly because it tells you which games to play. It's these large scale paretto distributed systems which are worth trying to win (the 10/2 systems) not the normally distributed systems and not the smaller paretto distributed systems
