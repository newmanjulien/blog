#The utility of polytheism and monotheism

Polytheism has been a tool to accelerate expansion. While monotheism has been a tool for increasing unity

Polytheism is a religion which includes many gods. These many gods are simply the gods of conquered people

For example, Zeus might have been the god of a Minoans city in Crete. When they conquered a neighboring city whose god was Poseidon they included that conquered city's god in their religion

This inclusive approach clearly has the benefit of more successfully integrating conquered people into your group

Which obviously gives you an edge against competitors who would not be willing to integrate other people's gods in their religion

But at some point you then run into another type of problem: disunity

Yes. You've successfully integrated many people's into your group. But maybe your group is now meaningless because it's too broadly defined

Which is when monotheism becomes attractive

For example, Constantine was faced with civil war and disunity and part of his response was to adopt Christianity as a single religion which would unite the Roman empire

It's interesting to think about how this might help understand the contemporary interplay between ideologies which preach diveristy and ideologies which preach nationalism
