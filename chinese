#Gaining leverage with Chinese products

It occurs to me that a way to get leverage in a US context might be to use Chinese products aggressively

For example, everyone is paying $1,500 for an iPhone and I can pay $150 for a Xiaomi. Or I can use Kimi instead of ChatGPT

Some Chinese products seems to be 99% as good as cutting edge US products. While being 10X cheaper

And almost everyone in the US is completely blind to this
