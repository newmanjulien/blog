One of the interesting facts about businesses is that the office space they make available to most employees sucks

Even white shoe law firms have crappy office space for most of their lawyers. They have nice rooms for hosting clients. And nice offices for the most senior people. But it's not reasonable to give a nice space to everyone

Same for businesses like Google which seem to have infinite ressources for anything else

This is actually a huge problem because the space you're in molds your behavior. Meaning that the average productivity is bound to be exponentially decreased by this crappy office situation

Still. This is a rational choice because it's so ridiculously expensive to provide nice office space to everyone

One solution which has been tried are open offices. Nice space. But miniature square footage per employee

Open offices work in banking where they originate. Because it's a frenetic industry which is enhanced by stronger groupthink. And where thoughtfulness doesn't mean much

But they're not a fit for most industries. For example, it's horrible for software developers to work in an open space

Another solution which is more in vogue today is letting employees work from home. Well paid employees already have a nice home. So they get a nice workspace with 0 additional cost

Work from home is known to not work of course. Not being forced to be side-by-side with colleagues breaks down trust between team members. Which creates an insurmountable barrier to speedy collaboration

Is there a solution that's actually good?

Maybe the answer are AI team members

For example, Paul Weiss might fire everyone other than their Senior Partners. Then replace them with AI tools. And AIs don't need office space

This is easier said than done. And isn't possible in all industries. But the intersection of office space dynamics and productivity might be yet another factor which boosts output in AI-first workplaces
